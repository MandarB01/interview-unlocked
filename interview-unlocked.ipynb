    "OK. I have populated the interview-unlocked.ipynb notebook with the Python code to implement the multi-agent interview preparation system based on your design.md file and using LangGraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook now contains the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Setup and Imports:** Installs necessary packages (commented out by default) and imports all required libraries and modules. It also sets up configurations like FAISS paths and initializes the LLM and embedding models.\n",
    "2.  **Tool Definitions:** Implements all the tools required by the agents, such as text extraction, embedding generation, vector retrieval, web search, LeetCode retrieval (placeholder), audio recording/transcription, and evaluation helper tools (placeholders).\n",
    "3.  **Agent Definitions:** Defines the `InterviewState` TypedDict to manage the data flow between agents. It includes the prompts for each agent (Preprocessing, Knowledge, Planner, Question, Evaluation) derived from design.md and sets up the agent nodes using LangGraph's `ToolNode` and a helper function.\n",
    "4.  **Graph Definition:** Constructs the `StateGraph`, adds nodes for each agent and its tools, defines the sequential edges connecting them (Preprocessing -> Knowledge -> Planner -> Question -> Record Answer -> Evaluate -> END), and compiles the graph. It also includes code to optionally visualize the graph structure.\n",
    "5.  **Execution and Interaction:** Provides an example of how to run the graph. You'll need to **modify the `resume_file` and `jd_file` variables** to point to your actual resume and job description files. It then runs the graph asynchronously, streams the events (like tool calls and LLM outputs), and finally prints the key outputs extracted from the final state (study plan, suggested LeetCode, generated question, transcribed answer, and evaluation feedback).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please review the notebook, especially the placeholder file paths in the \"Execution and Interaction\" section, and ensure your environment (API keys, Ollama server if used, Google Cloud credentials) is set up correctly before running the cells.\n"
